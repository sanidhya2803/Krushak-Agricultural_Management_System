    <p class="a"><b>Information:</b></p> 
    <p class="b"><br>Black soil is also known as “Regur Soil” or the “Black Cotton Soil”. It covers about 15% of the total land area of the country.
        The colour of these soils varies from deep black to grey. Black soils are rich in iron, lime, aluminium, magnesium and also contain potassium. 
        However, these soils are deficient in nitrogen, phosphorus and organic matter.</p>

    <p class="a"><b>Climate Condition:</b></p> 
    <p class="b"><br>The black soils are generally clayey, deep and impermeable. They swell greatly and become sticky when wet in the rainy season. 
        In the dry season, the moisture evaporates, the soil shrinks and develops wide cracks.</p>
